## Prompt
> [!NOTE]
> The readline() function can cause memory leaks. We donâ€™t have to fix them
 - handling prompt
 - handling history

## Lexer
> [!NOTE]
> We have to handle '$' with environment variables and '?'
>
> We don't have to handle unclosed quotes or special characters which are not required by the subject such as '\\' or ';'
- text spliting
- tokens creation
- token assignment

## Parser
- linked list creation
- linked list reading method

## Interpreter
- main execution from linked list (ast in recursive descent)

## Builtins

- cd with only a relative or absolute path
- pwd with no options
- export with no options
- unset with no options
- env with no options or arguments
- exit with no options

## Signals
- ctrl-c
